# Decision Tree Classifier for Predicting Customer Deposits:
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview
This project aims to build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will deposit money into a bank based on their demographic and behavioral data. The classifier is trained on the Bank Marketing dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Decision Tree Classifier is a popular algorithm used for classification tasks in machine learning.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the Bank Marketing dataset ('bank-additional.csv') from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and place it in the project directory.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook 'Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb' to execute the code and train the Decision Tree Classifier.
4. Follow the instructions and code comments provided in the notebook to understand each step of the process.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bank Marketing dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features related to customer demographics, behavior, and previous marketing campaigns. The target variable is 'deposit', indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

## Implementation
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling duplicated values, extracting numerical and categorical columns, descriptive statistical analysis, and visualization.
- Feature Selection: Removing highly correlated columns to avoid multicollinearity.
- Label Encoding: Converting categorical columns into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
- Splitting the Dataset: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Decision Tree Classifier: Building and training the Decision Tree Classifier model using Scikit-learn.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Visualization: Plotting the decision tree for visualization using Matplotlib.

## Results
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 90% on the testing dataset. The confusion matrix and classification report provide insights into the model's performance in predicting customer deposits.
